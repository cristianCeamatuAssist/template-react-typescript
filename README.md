# This is a React Typescript Redux Toolkit template

> Extra notes, ex: We recommend visiting the app from a desktop/notebook because it is not mobile responsive

<!--
## Core functionality
****
- Users can securely login in the app
- Users can add call through a form or by uploading a CSV file
- Users can filter/sort/search the call list
- Users can start calls and see the transcript of the conversation between the Virtual Agent and the contact
- Users can listen the audio stream of the conversation
- Users can edit/ignore Virtual Agents responses, they can Take Over the conversation or Transfer the call to their phone number
- Users can collect valuable information when the call ends -->

## Prerequisites

To get this project up and running locally, you must have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed locally.

## Getting Started

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**

1. Run:

```
  > yarn install
```

2. From the root folder please run the following commands (this will lint you code before each commit):

   ```bash
     > npx husky install

     # IMPORTANT! Only if the .husky/pre-commit is not defined already or it does not contain `yarn lint-staged`
     > npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "yarn lint-staged"
   ```

3. Run `yarn start` to start the project, it should automatically redirect or you can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app. The server refreshes every time you make a change to a file.<br>
4. Most important, enjoy the app!<br>

## Built With

- Typescript
- React.js create-react-app
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
