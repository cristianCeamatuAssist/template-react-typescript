## Prerequisites

To get this project up and running locally, you must have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed locally.

## Getting Started
**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**
1. Run:

2. From the root folder please run the following commands (this will lint you code before each commit):
    ```bash
      > npx husky install

      # IMPORTANT! Only if the .husky/pre-commit is not defined already or it does not contain `yarn lint-staged`
      > npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "yarn lint-staged"
    ```
3. Run `yarn start` to start the project, it should automatically redirect or you can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app. The server refreshes every time you make a change to a file.<br>
4. Most important, enjoy the app!<br>
